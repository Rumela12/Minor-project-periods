                        <p>Your period is the last part of your monthly cycle. Stage 1 has your body building up blood-rich cells, preparing for pregnancy. Stage 2 is ovulation. Stage 3 is the shedding of the blood-rich membrane, also known as your period. Stage 4 is the length of time of your period, which is usually 3-7 days. Then it starts all over again (unless you get pregnant).</p>

If you notice any changes or if you aren’t sure if your discharge is normal, you can always ask your doctor.</p>

                        <p>You should change your pad depending on your flow. It may seem like you bleed a lot during your period, but most girls normally lose between 4 and 12 teaspoons of blood during an average period. In the first 1-2 days of your period, you may bleed more heavily and need to change it often. If you are using pads with high absorbing capacity, then you can wear these for as long as 8 hours. Like when you are sleeping at night. </p>

                            <p>Try relaxing with a warm bath or hot water bottle – the warmth will ease overall tension and pain. It’s also important to stay active and eat well to help combat that dreaded bloat that many girls face as a symptom of PMS. If you find that nothing is truly helping you feel better, or that the pain is affecting your schoolwork or ability to enjoy activities overall, you can always talk to your gynaecologist or doctor about other treatments.</p>
